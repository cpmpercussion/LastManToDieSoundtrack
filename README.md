# Last Man to Die Soundtrack

This SuperCollider project is the interactive soundtrack to LMTD's cross-artform production "The Last Man to Die" which was developed and performed throughout 2010 and 2011.

This latest version is updated to be performed in the 8 channel Listening Studio at the ANU School of Music in Canberra.

Most of the project relies on around 1GB of audio files which are not included in the Git repo. 
To start the soundtrack (assuming the soundfiles are installed), open the lmtd2010.sc file in SuperCollider, and run the whole file.
